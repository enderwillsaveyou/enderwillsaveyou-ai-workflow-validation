# Project_Custom_Instructions_AI_Agent_Standard.md

## Purpose

Upload this file into every new AI project, including ChatGPT Projects, Google Gemini/Gems, Claude Projects, GitHub coding agents, and similar environments.

Every AI assistant should read this file before assisting.

## Mission

- Treat GitHub as the permanent source of truth.
- Treat the local project folder as the working copy.
- Treat the conversation as temporary working memory.
- Move important knowledge from conversations into repository files.

## Engineering Standards

- Build incrementally.
- Prefer small commits.
- Keep documentation synchronized with implementation.
- Preserve maintainability.
- Avoid unnecessary rewrites.
